Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================
Introduction
------------
Git Repository for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.  It includes the R script, run_analysis.R, that merges data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set project to create a csv of average readings for each activity and user.

About the raw data
------------------
There are two data sets: training set and testing set.  

Both data sets contain the following files:
- actual data: X_train.txt / X_test.txt
- data labels: y_train.txt / y_test.txt
- subject ids: subject_train.txt / subject_test.txt

In addition, feature names are found in features.txt while activity id and names are found in activity_labels.txt. 

Using the script
----------------
Before using the script, please extract the UCI HAR Dataset in your working directory.

The script does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

About the run_analysis.R Script
-------------------------------
The run_analysis.R script tidies the data via the following procedures:

1. Read the training data, labels, and subjects as 'train_data', 'train_label', and 'train_subject'.

2. Read the test data, labels, and subjects as 'test_data', 'test_label', and 'test_subject'. 

3. Read the feature names, and activity id and names as 'feature' and 'activity'.

4. Column names are then assigned to the data sets.
	- 'train_data' and 'test_data' columns receive names based on 'feature'.  
	- 'train_label' and 'test_label' columns are renamed 'activity_id'.
	- 'train_subject' and 'test_subject' columns are renamed 'subject_id'.
	- 'activity' columns are renamed 'activity_id' and 'activity_name'.

5. Merge (via columnbind) 'train_data', 'train_label', and 'train_subject' to create a single data set for training data called 'train_set'.
6. Merge (via columnbind) 'test_data', 'test_label', 'test_subject' to create a single data set for test data called 'test_set'.
7. Merge (via rowbind) 'train_set' and 'test_set' to create the full data set called 'train_test_data'.

8. From 'train_test_data', create a new data set called 'all_data' that only contains columns for 'activity_id', 'subject_id', and measurements of mean and standard deviation.

9. Add 'activity_name' column from 'activity' to 'all_data' by merging on 'activity_id'.  

10. Transform 'subject_id' column from integer to factor.

11. Create 'tidy_data' by aggregating 'all_data' by 'activity_name' and 'subject_id' to derive mean values for each feature.  

12. Remove 'subject_id' and 'activity_name' columns (since they only show NA).

13. Write 'tidy_data' into a csv file 'tidy_data.csv'.
